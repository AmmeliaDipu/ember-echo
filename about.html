            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Established in 1996 by Mrs. Anita Tripati with a small team of 15, our organization was one of the early adopters of corporate sustainable practices. Recognizing the need early on, we built our foundation on sustainability.
                Initially based in Mumbai, our operations were limited to organizing events within the Mumbai metropolitan area for the first two years. However, as our team grew, we expanded into other metro cities across India. </p>
                
            <p>Today, we manage events in over 50 major cities nationwide.
                After 15 years in the industry, we saw an opportunity to expand into the Middle East, driven by the region’s rapid corporate growth. By our 25th year, we had successfully established operations across Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East, with a team of over 150 passionate professionals.
                As we approach our 30th year, we plan to further expand into the European Union while continuing to grow our team and strengthen our global presence.</p>
